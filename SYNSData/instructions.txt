Please download the SYNS dataset from its authors' website before running the SYNS_RGB_to_luminance demo: https://syns.soton.ac.uk/browse
The SYNS dataset is an academic dataset collected at the University of Southampton, to which we are not in any way affiliated.

The scenes used in our work were the following:

9 indoor scenes:
- Indoor Lecture Hall #81
- Indoor Office #82
- Indoor Classroom #83
- Indoor Office #85
- Indoor Living Room #86
- Indoor Foyer #88
- Indoor Lecture Hall #89
- Indoor Cafe #90
- Indoor Living Room #92

10 outdoor scenes:
- Outdoor Urban #1
- Outdoor Suburban #2
- Outdoor Retail #3
- Outdoor Forest #4
- Outdoor Wetlands #5
- Outdoor Forest #6
- Outdoor Forest #26
- Outdoor Glass Houses #31
- Outdoor Beach #37
- Outdoor Forest #71

The folder structure is set up as in the examples below for indoor scene #81. The top path is for the .hdr image containing the image capture we will use to extract the luminance information. The second path is for the metadata file that has the camera exposure, ISO, and f values we need to compute luminance.
SYNSData -> indoor -> SYNS_scene_81_indoor_Lecturehall -> SYNSData -> 81 -> rep1.hdr
SYNSData -> indoor -> SYNS_scene_81_indoor_Lecturehall -> SYNSData -> 81 -> I_25_81.txt

The same is repeated for e.g. outdoor scene #1:
SYNSData -> outdoor -> SYNS_scene_1_outdoor_Urban -> SYNSData -> 1 -> rep1.hdr
SYNSData -> outdoor -> SYNS_scene_1_outdoor_Urban -> SYNSData -> 1 -> O_1_14.txt
